Security in supply chain is challenging due to the inherent vulnerabilities and threats from any part of the system which can be exploited at any point within the supply chain. This can cause a severe disruption on the overall business continuity. Therefore, it is paramount important to understand and predicate the threats so that organization can undertake necessary control measures for the supply chain security. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) provides an intelligence analysis to discover unknown to known threats using various properties including threat actor skill and motivation, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedure (TT and P), and Indicator of Compromise (IoC). This paper aims to analyse and predicate threats to improve cyber supply chain security. We have applied Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyse and predict the threats based on the CTI properties. That allows to identify the inherent CSC vulnerabilities so that appropriate control actions can be undertaken for the overall cybersecurity improvement. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, CTI data is gathered and a number of ML algorithms, i.e., Logistic Regression (LG), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), are used to develop predictive analytics using the Microsoft Malware Prediction dataset. The experiment considers attack and TTP as input parameters and vulnerabilities and Indicators of compromise (IoC) as output parameters. The results relating to the prediction reveal that Spyware/Ransomware and spear phishing are the most predictable threats in CSC. We have also recommended relevant controls to tackle these threats. We advocate using CTI data for the ML predicate model for the overall CSC cyber security improvement.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3087109","Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University through the Vice Deanship of Scientific Research Chairs: Chair of Pervasive and Mobile Computing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448097","Cyber threat intelligence;machine learning;cyber supply chain;predictive analytic;cyber security;tactic techniques procedures","Supply chains;Machine learning;Prediction algorithms;Cyberattack;Computer security;Classification algorithms;Support vector machines","business continuity;computer crime;decision trees;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;security of data;support vector machines","Cyber Threat Intelligence;inherent CSC vulnerabilities;CTI data;predictable threats;CSC cyber security improvement;Cyber Threat predictive analytics;improving Cyber Supply Chain security;Cyber Supply Chain system;different sub-systems;known threats;properties including threat actor skill","","20","","40","CCBY","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cyber threats are on the rise and securing industrial networks are challenging with the shortage of human resource in OT field, with more inclination to IT/OT convergence and the attackers deploy various hi-tech methods to intrude the control systems nowadays. We have developed an innovative real-time ICS cyber test kit to obtain the OT industrial network traffic data with various industrial attack vectors. In this paper, we have introduced the industrial datasets generated from ICS test kit, which incorporate the cyber-physical system of industrial operations. These datasets with a normal baseline along with different industrial hacking scenarios are analyzed for research purposes. Metadata is obtained from Deep packet inspection (DPI) of flow properties of network packets. DPI analysis provides more visibility into the contents of OT traffic based on communication protocols. The advancement in technology has led to the utilization of machine learning/artificial intelligence capability in IDS ICS SCADA. The industrial datasets are pre-processed, profiled and the abnormality is analyzed with DPI. The processed metadata is normalized for the easiness of algorithm analysis and modelled with machine learning-based latest deep learning ensemble LSTM algorithms for anomaly detection.

To trace hackers’ behaviors and footprints, it is crucial to provide additional information such as attack tactics, techniques, and procedures in detecting attacks. In this study, we propose a mechanism for labeling attack tactics of network intrusion detection system (NIDS) rules on the basis of text mining and machine learning. The proposed approach can help security experts determine the current attack state and infer its purpose, making it possible to detect complex attacks (e.g., APT). Besides, we refer to the ATT&CK framework developed by MITRE (a leading organization in information security) to strengthen the reliability of labeling results. The experiment result shows that the accuracy of our proposed mechanism can effectively boost the performance of the labeling attack tactic. The experimental result shows that the F1 score of our approach is more than 90% and up to approximately 96%, which can effectively assist cyber security experts in tactic labeling and provides a solid base for further alert correlation.

To address this challenge, machine learning techniques such as deep learning algorithms are being applied to simplify data processing and uncover hidden patterns that may indicate a cyberattack. In this context, a deep neural network’s structure is suggested for the detection phase, which must alert the system to the attack’s presence in its early stages.Furthermore, robust control techniques have been studied to isolate the offending agent in the leader-follower system. The control system utilizes a reputation algorithm to isolate the misbehaving agent following the attack detection phase using a deep neural network.Experimental studies have shown that deep learning algorithms can detect threats more effectively than traditional approaches, making cybersecurity easier, more proactive, less expensive, and significantly more successful.

These anomalies may be presented as data outliers in the standard logs with records with users’ actions on the web resources. To solve this problem, an algorithm for detecting anomalies in the behavior of users of web platforms based on machine learning is proposed. Standard audit logs and user browser fingerprints were used as a set of features to identify a user and/or his device. The algorithm detects anomalies (data outliers) in user behavior based on three classifiers: OneClassSVM, IsolationForest, and EllipticEnvelope. If anomalies are detected, one or more authentication factors are used for additional verification of the user. The proposed algorithm is aimed at increasing the security of the target web system based on the risk assessment of the threat of users’ abnormal behavior in near real time. The experiment showed that it is generally possible to use both IsolationForest and EllipticEnvelope as the main classifier. In particular, EllipticEnvelope has a higher average accuracy on large datasets of user activity (up to 1600 records per user). However, the use of IsolationForest gives the best value of maximum average accuracy, especially for small logs (up to 100 records per user).","","978-1-6654-6429-1","10.1109/SmartIndustryCon57312.2023.10110791","Russian Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10110791","multi-factor authentication;browser fingerprint;outlier detection;anomaly detection;user behavior;standard audit log;web platform","Machine learning algorithms;Authentication;Machine learning;Fingerprint recognition;Behavioral sciences;Classification algorithms;Risk management","auditing;authorisation;computer network security;cyber-physical systems;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);message authentication;online front-ends;pattern classification;risk management;security of data;software fault tolerance","authentication factors;authentication procedures;behavioral analytics;data outliers;EllipticEnvelope;enhanced user authentication algorithm;information security;IsolationForest;standard audit logs;standard logs;target web system;user behavior;user browser fingerprints;web platforms;web resources;web-based cyberphysical systems","","","","27","IEEE","1 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, the familiarity of Ethernet and TCP/IP protocols and the diversity and success of attacks on them raises security risks and cyber threats for ICS. This issue is compounded by the absence of encryption, authorization, and authentication mechanisms due to the development of industrial communications protocols only for performance purposes. Recent zero-day attacks, such as Triton, Stuxnet, Havex, Dragonfly, and Blackenergy, as well as the Ukraine cyber-attack, are possible because of the vulnerabilities of the systems; these attacksare carried by the protocols used in communication between PLC and I/O units or HMI and engineering stations. It is evident that there is a need for robust solutions that detect and prevent protocol-based cyber threats. In this paper, machine learning methods are evaluated for anomaly detection, particularly for EtherCAT-based ICS. To the best of the author's knowledge, there has been no research focusing on machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection of EtherCAT. Before testing anomaly detection, an EtherCAT-based water level control system testbed was developed. Then, a total of 16 events were generated in four categories and applied on the testbed. The dataset created was used for anomaly detection. The results showed that the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and support vector machine with genetic algorithm (SVM GA) models perform best among the 18 techniques applied. In addition to detecting anomalies, the methods are able to flag the attack types better than other techniques and are applicable in EtherCAT networks. Also, the dataset and events can be used for further studies since it is difficult to obtain data for ICS due to its critical infrastructure and continuous real-time operation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960497","Sakarya Üniversitesi(grant numbers:2015-50-02-025); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu(grant numbers:118E263); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936397","Anomaly detection;EtherCAT security;ICS security;machine learning for EtherCAT","Anomaly detection;Protocols;Machine learning;Integrated circuit modeling;Security;Level control","critical infrastructures;genetic algorithms;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);local area networks;production engineering computing;SCADA systems;support vector machines;transport protocols","zero-day attacks;Ukraine cyber-attack;protocol-based cyber threats;machine learning methods;EtherCAT-based ICS;machine learning algorithms;water level control system testbed;EtherCAT networks;EtherCAT-based anomaly detection;Ethernet-based protocols;industrial control systems communications;supervisory control;industrial communications protocols","","17","","39","CCBY","18 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result of these improvements, numerous new channels of communication are being created, one of which is the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT has recently emerged as cutting-edge technology for creating smart environments. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a subset of the IoT, in which medical equipment exchange information with each other to exchange sensitive information. These developments enable the healthcare business to maintain a higher level of touch and care for its patients. Security is seen as a significant challenge in whatsoever technology’s reliance based on the IoT. Security difficulties occur owing to the various potential attacks posed by attackers. There are numerous security concerns, such as remote hijacking, impersonation, denial of service attacks, password guessing, and man-in-the-middle. In the event of such attacks, critical data associated with IoT connectivity may be revealed, altered, or even rendered inaccessible to authorized users. As a result, it turns out to be critical to safeguard the IoT/IoMT ecosystem against malware assaults. The main goal of this study is to demonstrate how a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and supervised machine learning models (random forest, decision tree, KNN, and ridge classifier) can be utilized to develop an efficient and effective IDS in the IoMT environment for classifying and forecasting unexpected cyber threats. Preprocessing and normalization of network data are performed. Following that, we optimized features using a bio-inspired particle swarm algorithm.

Trojan viruses and botnet programs play an important role in the Internet black industry chain. How to deal with cyber security incidents quickly and efficiently is a problem that needs to be solved. It has been found that the malware infected users are widely distributed and have diverse types, which cause great difficulties for cybersecurity experts to handle the threats. Based on practical cybersecurity incident handling experience, this paper proposes a User-Event Threat Matrix Model to define the infected users, and implement a classification method based on machine learning algorithm.

Many new methods of cybercrimes are coming which cannot be solved using earlier conventional method like using firewalls, antivirus, old ML algorithms. In recent years every device whether it’s hardware or software is being connected with IOT. Hence, there is huge growth in data also their privacy is huge concern for industries. In this model, we are implementing Network Intrusion detection system using Machine learning algorithms which would resolve security problems using KNN, SVM, LR, RF, DT and Gaussian NB with greater efficiency. Our system uses both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. Both misuse and Anomaly based detection to detect malware and viruses, our system is capable to detect both known and unknown attacks. In case of misuse detection system known attacks are being easily identified using a database where list of all known attacks is available. If any attack happens on network system, then NIDS checks whether the attack is listed in dataset or not. If attack is known, then system administrator gets notified. If attack is unknown, then NIDS uses outlier detection to identify attack using several machine learning algorithms like clustering and other techniques. So, with the help of above-mentioned techniques attack is being detected. Our model improves the attack detection mechanism with high accuracy and less prediction time. It is better than previous conventional machine learning algorithms. Our model is broadly accepted in companies and organization. it is fulfilling the cyber security issue also threat prediction time of our model is quite improved and the prediction time is reduced as compared to previous model.","","978-1-6654-7436-8","10.1109/ICAC3N56670.2022.10074106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074106","KNN;SVM;LR;RF;DT;NB","Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Machine learning algorithms;Firewalls (computing);Computational modeling;Software algorithms;Network intrusion detection","computer crime;computer network security;Internet of Things;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines;unsupervised learning","above-mentioned techniques attack;Anomaly based detection;attack detection mechanism;earlier conventional method;misuse detection system known attacks;Network Intrusion detection system;network system;old ML algorithms;outlier detection;positive effect;previous conventional machine learning algorithms;supervised machine learning techniques;system administrator;unsupervised machine learning techniques","","","","12","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research has shown that such threats often come from malicious insiders. To identify these insiders, survey- and electrocardiogram-based approaches have been proposed; however, these approaches cannot effectively detect or predict any malicious insiders. Recently, electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been suggested as a potential alternative to detect these potential threats. Threat detection using EEG would be highly reliable as it overcomes the limitations of the previous methods. This study proposes a proof of concept for a system wherein a model trained using a deep learning algorithm is employed to evaluate EEG signals to detect insider threats. The algorithm can classify different mental states based on four category risk matrices. In particular, it analyses brainwave signals using long short-term memory (LSTM) designed to remember the previous mental states of each insider and compare them with the current brain state for associated risk-level classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we performed a comparative analysis using logistic regression (LR)-a predictive analysis technique used to describe the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables-on the same dataset. The experimental results obtained suggest that LSTM can achieve a classification accuracy of more than 80% compared to LR, which yields a classification accuracy of approximately 51%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037979","Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, Khalifa University(grant numbers:8474000137-RC1-C2PS-T3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9258932","Deep learning;EEG sensors;fitness evaluation;insider threats;LSTM;safety critical industrial infrastructure","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Security;Support vector machines;Safety;Feature extraction;Electrodes","electrocardiography;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;regression analysis;security of data;signal classification","insider threats;mental states;brain state;associated risk-level classification;safety critical industrial infrastructure;malicious insiders;threat detection;deep learning algorithm;EEG signals;EEG sensor-based risk framework;electrocardiogram-based approach;long short-term memory;logistic regression;predictive analysis technique;brainwave signals","","6","","32","CCBY","13 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

External attackers often utilize vulnerable IoT devices to invade the target’s internal network and then further cause a security threat to the whole network. To prevent such attacks, it is necessary to develop a security mechanism to control the access of suspicious IoT devices and manage the internal devices. In recent years, deep learning (DL) algorithm has been widely used in the field of edge device identification (EDI), and has made great achievements. However, these previous methods are essentially centralized learning-based EDI (CentEDI) that trains all data together, which can not guarantee data security and not conducive to deployment on edge devices. To address this problem, we introduce a federated learning-based EDI (FedeEDI) method via network traffic to automatically identify edge devices connected to the whole network. Experimental results show that the training efficiency of our proposed FedeEDI method is much higher than that of the CentEDI method, although its classification accuracy is slightly reduced. In contrast to the CentEDI method, the proposed FedeEDI method has two main advantages: faster training speed and safer training process.","2332-7731","","10.1109/TCCN.2021.3101239","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP19H02142); Major Project of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China(grant numbers:TC190A3WZ-2); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901228); Summit of the Six Top Talents Program of Jiangsu(grant numbers:XYDXX-010); Program for High-Level Entrepreneurial and Innovative Team(grant numbers:CZ002SC19001); project of the Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications (BUPT) of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:KFKT-2020106); Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG(grant numbers:A2102); Zhejiang University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9502154","Internet of Things;edge device identification;network traffic;centralized learning;federated learning;deep learning","Security;Object recognition;Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Training;Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms","authorisation;computer crime;computer network security;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","access control;CentEDI;centralized learning-based EDI;classification accuracy;data security;edge device identification;external attackers;FedeEDI;federated learning-based EDI;internal devices;Internet of Things;IoT devices;network traffic feature engineering;security threat;training efficiency;training speed","","13","","48","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the introduction of industrial control systems in the 1970' s, industrial networks have been the target of malicious actors. More recently, the political and warfare-aspects of attacks on industrial and critical infrastructure are becoming more relevant. In contrast to classic home and office IT systems, industrial IT, so-called OT systems, have an effect on the physical world. Furthermore, industrial devices have long operation times, sometimes several decades. Updates and fixes are tedious and often not possible. The threats on industry with the legacy requirements of industrial environments creates the need for efficient intrusion detection that can be integrated into existing systems. In this work, the network data containing industrial operation is analysed with machine learning- and time series-based anomaly detection algorithms in order to discover the attacks introduced to the data. Two different data sets are used, one Modbus-based gas pipeline control traffic and one OPC UA-based batch processing traffic. In order to detect attacks, two machine learning-based algorithms are used, namely SVM and Random Forest. Both perform well, with Random Forest slightly outperforming SVM. Furthermore, extracting and selecting features as well as handling missing data is addressed in this work.","1847-358X","978-953-290-088-0","10.23919/SOFTCOM.2019.8903672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8903672","Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence;Cyber Security;IT Security;Industrial","","batch processing (industrial);computer network security;industrial control;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;time series","physical world;operation times;industrial environments;network data;industrial operation;time series-based anomaly detection algorithms;Modbus-based gas pipeline control traffic;OPC UA-based batch processing traffic;machine learning-based algorithms;SVM;missing data;anomaly-based intrusion detection;industrial data;random forests;industrial enterprises;industrial control systems;industrial networks;malicious actors;political warfare-aspects;industrial infrastructure;critical infrastructure;OT systems","","37","","43","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the IIoT focuses on the availability of industrial production, it is unfeasible to study security issues directly on the industrial field. Thus, constructing an IIoT cyber range to reproduce industrial scenarios for offensive and defensive confrontation research is necessary. However, the traditional IIoT cyber range relies on physical industrial field devices that are not reproducible and hard to recover from cyber attacks. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework for a digital twin based cyber range and a digital twin construction method with multiple models. Cyber ranges with digital twins are more flexible and convenient. Based on the proposed method, an industrial scenario is reproduced using machine learning algorithms to predict temperature changes from different perspectives.

To create a desired financial environment, an effective method is urgently needed to automatically detect and identify Ethereum frauds in the governance of the Ethereum system. In view of this, this paper proposes a method for detecting Ethereum frauds by mining Ethereum-based transaction records. Specifically, web crawlers are used to capture labeled fraudulent addresses, and then a transaction network is reconstructed based on the public transaction book. Then, an amount-based network embedding algorithm is proposed to extract node features for identifying fraudulent transactions. At last, the graph convolutional network model is used to classify addresses into legal addresses and fraudulent addresses. The experimental results show that the system for detecting fraudulent transactions can achieve the accuracy of 95%, which reflects the excellent performance of the system for detecting Ethereum fraudulent transactions.","","978-1-6654-3858-2","10.1109/ICKG52313.2021.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9667674","Ethereum;abnormal transaction recognition;machine learning;graph neural network","Knowledge engineering;Industries;Online banking;Law;Conferences;Crawlers;Feature extraction","blockchains;computer crime;data mining;financial data processing;fraud;graph theory;neural nets","graph convolutional network;Ethereum fraudulent transactions;graph neural network;Ethereum fraud detection;Ethereum network;financial environment;Ethereum-based transaction records;transaction network;public transaction book;network embedding algorithm;digital currency","","2","","34","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
